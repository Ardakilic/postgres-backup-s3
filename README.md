This is a fork and restructuring of schickling's [postgres-backup-s3](https://github.com/schickling/dockerfiles/tree/master/postgres-backup-s3) and [postgres-restore-s3](https://github.com/schickling/dockerfiles/tree/master/postgres-restore-s3).

See [`backup/README.md`](/backup/README.md) and [`restore/README.md`](/restore/README.md) for further instructions.

Fork goals:
  - [x] dedicated repository
  - [x] automated builds
  - [x] support multiple PostgreSQL versions
  - [ ] support encrypted (password-protected) backups
  - [ ] merge backup and restore images?
